*(I've slightly cleaned it up to remove the STS/NetBeans parts you aren't using and kept the essentials for Maven, IntelliJ, and VS Code, but your original file is perfectly fine too.)*

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

Now that you have the correct `.gitignore` file, open your VS Code terminal and make sure you are in the correct backend project folder: `PS D:\bankingapp\bankingapp>`.

Run these commands one by one to push your code:

1.  **Initialize Git (if you haven't already):**
    ```powershell
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all your files to be tracked (Git will automatically ignore the files listed in `.gitignore`):**
    ```powershell
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Make your first commit:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Completed banking application backend"
    ```

4.  **Rename the branch to `main`:**
    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    ```

5.  **Connect to your GitHub repository (copy the URL from your GitHub page):**
    ```powershell
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/banking-app-backend.git
    ```

6.  **Push your code to GitHub:**
    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
